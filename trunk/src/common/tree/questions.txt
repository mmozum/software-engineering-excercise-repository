
Convert a min heap to BST without changing its structure and of course no extra space.
Convert BST to heap

check if  a tree is BST
Convert a doubly linked list to a binary search tree in place.
print binary tree by level/zigzag

Given a tree in which each node is an integer and an array with a set of integers, determine if all the elements of the array are present in the tree by visiting each node in the tree at most once.

cache!
Design a efficient cache, supporting retrieval of maximum element in cache along with other normal cache operations.
Suggest data structures to be used,also tell the complexities for each of the operations.

synchronization

Design an LRU cache with all the operations including getting the least recently used item to be O(1).


[1] Design a layer in front of a system which cache the last n requests and the responses to them from the system.
what data structure would you use to implement the cache in the later to support following operations.
[a] When a request comes look it up in the cache and if it hits then return the response from here and do not pass the request to the system
[b] If the request is not found in the cache then pass it on to the system
[c] Since cache can only store the last n requests, Insert the n+1th request in the cache and delete one of the older requests from the cache
The objective is to achieve all the three operations in O(1).

Design and implement APIs for caching web pages.
clarification: cache web pages on client by URL with a max cache size.
