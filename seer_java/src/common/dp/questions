Google Code Jam - Skyline
This is an old google code jam problem, but it seems good:

Given a list of contiguous buildings by width and height, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be embeded in the resulting skyline.

The maximum height of the buildings is 10,000.  The maximum number of buildings is 10,000,000.

Minimize your solution for running time based on the resources on a desktop machine.

For fun, analyze the running time and memory requirements of your solution.  Does your solution hold if the restriction on the maximum building height is removed? 


Palindrome Partition



You have to paint N boards of length {B1, B2, B3бн BN}. There are K painters 
available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 
unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the 
constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of board, 
say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.


Given an array of integers A, give an algorithm to find the longest Arithmetic progression in it, i.e find a sequence i1 < i2 < бн < ik, such that
A[i1], A[i2], бн, A[ik] forms an arithmetic progression, and k is the largest possible.
The sequence S1, S2, бн, Sk is called an arithmetic progression if
Sj+1 иC Sj is a constant


Given a sorted array of n integers, pick up k elements so that the minimal 
difference between consecutive elements is maximal (that is choose the elements 
to maximize the quantity min(a[i+1] - a[i]))
