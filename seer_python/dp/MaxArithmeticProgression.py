#Given an array of integers A, give an algorithm to find the longest Arithmetic progression in it, i.e find a sequence i1 < i2 < бн < ik, such that
#A[i1], A[i2], бн, A[ik] forms an arithmetic progression, and k is the largest possible.
#The sequence S1, S2, бн, Sk is called an arithmetic progression if
#Sj+1 иC Sj is a constant
